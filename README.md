# SlidePuzzle
A simple version of the classic "fifteen puzzle" game.

The main thing I think that's notable about this version is
the puzzle randomizer uses [the solvability criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle#Solvability)
to randomize in a "smarter" way than merely shuffling tiles randomly like a player would.
